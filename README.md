# ESmart Weather Monitoring System with Edge AI and Cloud Integration
30-Day Project Plan
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a Smart Weather Monitoring System that:
   
    1. Collects environmental data (temperature, humidity, and air quality) using sensors.
    
    2. Processes the data locally using AI for anomaly detection.
    
    3. Sends the data to AWS IoT Core for visualization and storage.
    
    4. Provides real-time alerts for anomalies.

This project will help you gain hands-on experience in embedded systems, AI/ML, and cloud computing.

**Hardware Requirements**
    
    Microcontroller Board: ESP32 DevKit V1 (ESP32-WROOM-32).
    
    Sensors:
        Temperature and Humidity: DHT22 or BME280.
        Air Quality: MQ-135.
    
    Power Supply: USB cable or battery pack.
    
    Miscellaneous: Jumper wires, breadboard.

**Software Requirements**

    Development Environment:
        Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
        TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.
        AWS IoT SDK for Embedded C.

    Cloud Services:
        AWS IoT Core.
        AWS DynamoDB (for data storage).
        AWS QuickSight (for data visualization).
